# Status of our Team  

Since our team worked together on last week's project we more or less jumped passed the two first stages (Seeded, Formed) as the assignment was released. We started at the collaborating stage at the beginning of the project and after a couple of days of thinking about the assignment and a couple of long meetings, we felt like we had an idea of how the finished product would look like. At that stage, we feel that we reached the Performing stage. Everyone in the team was working in parallel and someone was always available in our chat to answer questions and make small and quick decisions, approve merge requests, etc. which allowed us to perform at a fast pace. We are not 100% done with the assignment (08/02/23 15:45) but we are almost ready for our presentation and very happy about our performance.
